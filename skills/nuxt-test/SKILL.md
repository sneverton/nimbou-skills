# Nuxt Test

Read `reference/test-conventions.md` before changing tests.

## Purpose

Map a module, run only its E2E coverage, stabilize flaky selectors, and add the smallest possible frontend hooks such as `data-testid` or `aria-label`.

## Workflow

1. Map the target pages, components, composables, and stores.
2. Run only the relevant Playwright tests.
3. Diagnose whether each failure belongs to the test, the frontend, or both.
4. Fix selectors and waits first.
5. Add `data-testid` only when a stable semantic selector is missing.
6. Create the missing tests and rerun the module suite.
