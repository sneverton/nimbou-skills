# Nuxt Systematic Debugging

Use this skill when the bug is clearly frontend-first: route rendering, hydration, browser state, network sequencing, Vuetify interaction, or flaky browser behavior around a Nuxt app.

If the failure is primarily in NestJS, Prisma, or backend contracts, use `nestjs-debug` instead.

## Core Rule

```text
NO FRONTEND FIXES BEFORE LIVE BROWSER EVIDENCE
```

A guessed selector change, watcher tweak, or SSR guard is still guessing if you have not observed the runtime state.

## Tool Bias

This skill is Codex-first and dual-harness friendly.

Prefer live evidence from the browser before editing code.

### Primary path in Codex: Chrome DevTools MCP

- use `mcp__chrome_devtools__take_snapshot` to inspect the rendered accessibility tree
- use `mcp__chrome_devtools__list_console_messages` for hydration, runtime, and Vue warnings
- use `mcp__chrome_devtools__list_network_requests` and `mcp__chrome_devtools__get_network_request` for failed API or asset calls
- use `mcp__chrome_devtools__evaluate_script` to inspect `window`, DOM state, route params, and client-side data
- use `mcp__chrome_devtools__performance_start_trace` and `mcp__chrome_devtools__performance_stop_trace` only when the bug is performance-sensitive
- use `mcp__chrome_devtools__lighthouse_audit` only when the claim is UX, accessibility, or best-practices drift rather than logic failure

### Secondary path: Playwright

Use Playwright, Playwright MCP, or the project's Playwright suite only when:
- the bug needs scripted reproduction
- the same interaction must be repeated
- timing or state transitions need assertions
- the failure already exists in E2E coverage
- a visual or multi-step regression needs a repeatable script

If DevTools MCP is unavailable in the current harness, fall back to Playwright plus application logs. Do not require `js_repl`, helper scripts, or a repo-specific browser wrapper that does not exist in this project.

## When To Use

Use for:
- SSR or hydration mismatch
- page renders wrong state after navigation
- stale filters, pagination, or query-param sync
- component interaction bugs in Vuetify dialogs, forms, tables, or drawers
- frontend-only auth or route-guard issues
- flaky Playwright failures caused by selectors, timing, or network sequencing

Do not use this skill to broadly rewrite or expand the Playwright suite. Use `nimbou-skills:nuxt-test` when the main work is E2E test coverage or stabilization.

## Mandatory Flow

### Phase 1: Reproduce in the Browser

1. Reproduce with exact route, viewport, auth state, and seed data.
2. Capture what the user actually sees:
   - rendered text and controls
   - console output
   - network requests
   - route and query params
   - DOM state before and after the interaction
3. Separate first-load, client navigation, and refresh behavior.
   - SSR-only failures and client-only failures usually have different causes.
4. Do a short QA inventory before touching code:
   - what user-visible claim is broken
   - what controls and text prove the claim
   - what loading, empty, error, and success states matter
   - whether the claim is functional, visual, or both

Do not inspect transient DOM details before the page reaches a stable observable state.

### Phase 2: Locate the Owning Boundary

Trace the failure through the frontend path:

```text
Route -> page/layout -> composable/store -> component -> network call -> rendered state
```

Determine where the contract first breaks:
- wrong route params or query parsing
- missing fetch trigger or stale watch dependency
- store mutation not reflected in UI
- Vuetify component not receiving expected props
- backend response is correct, but frontend mapping is wrong
- browser request is wrong before it ever reaches the backend

Do not treat a browser symptom as proof that the backend is wrong.

### Phase 3: Compare With a Working Path

Find the nearest working example in the same Nuxt codebase:
- same page pattern
- same composable or store pattern
- same form submission flow
- same table/filter/pagination behavior
- same Playwright selector style

Compare:
- `useAsyncData` or fetch lifecycle
- watchers and computed dependencies
- route sync and navigation timing
- prop flow into Vuetify components
- loading, empty, and error states
- selector stability and waiting strategy in tests

If the route was recently edited, compare the changed path against a full page reload. If unrelated shared code changed, prefer a clean browser relaunch before trusting cached state.

### Phase 4: Form One Hypothesis

State it explicitly:

```text
I think X is the root cause because Y.
```

Then test only that hypothesis.

Examples:
- "Hydration mismatch starts because the page reads `window` during SSR."
- "The table never refreshes because the watch source omits `page`."
- "The Playwright failure is test-side because the selector depends on transient Vuetify markup."

### Phase 5: Fix and Verify

1. Add or update the narrowest failing check first only when a regression needs proof.
   - Playwright for user-visible regressions
   - component or composable tests when the failure is local and already supported

   Use `nimbou-skills:nuxt-test` when you need to expand or stabilize Playwright coverage.

2. Apply one fix at the owning layer.
   - route/composable for state-sync bugs
   - page/component for rendering bugs
   - test selectors/waits for test-only failures

3. Verify with the same live evidence used during investigation.
   - rerun the browser path
   - recheck console and network
   - rerun the relevant scripted coverage only if the bug depended on it
4. End with a short QA pass:
   - re-check the original user-visible claim
   - verify one adjacent state that could regress
   - if the claim is visual, confirm layout and emphasis at the affected viewport
   - if the claim is functional only, do not inflate the pass into a full visual review

5. If the fix fails, stop and reopen the investigation.
   - After 2 failed fixes, your ownership assumption is probably wrong.
   - After 3 failed fixes, question the frontend boundary or data-flow design.

## Nuxt-Specific Smells

Stop and investigate when you see:
- `window`, `document`, or storage access during SSR without a guard
- duplicate fetches from overlapping lifecycle hooks and watchers
- route query state drifting from local component state
- UI fixes that hide a stale store or composable bug
- waits based on `timeout` instead of observable conditions
- Playwright selectors tied to generated Vuetify structure instead of semantics
- inspecting the DOM too early while async rendering is still settling

## Red Flags

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Let's add `nextTick` and see"
- "Maybe `await page.waitForTimeout(1000)` fixes it"
- "This is probably hydration weirdness"
- "I'll just force `client-only`"
- "The selector worked locally once"

Stop. Gather more browser evidence.

## Boundary With `nuxt-test`

- `nuxt-debug` is for investigation, ownership, and browser-verified fixes
- `nuxt-test` is for module-bounded Playwright coverage, selector discipline, waits, auth setup, and E2E stabilization
- If the main task is "make the suite trustworthy," route to `nuxt-test`

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Frontend focus | Exit criteria |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| 1. Reproduce | Exact browser state, console, network, route, QA inventory | Failure observed with evidence |
| 2. Boundary | Route, composable, component, request, render ownership | First broken contract identified |
| 3. Compare | Working Nuxt/Vuetify path | Concrete differences listed |
| 4. Hypothesis | One explanation only | Confirmed or rejected with evidence |
| 5. Fix | One fix, browser recheck, short QA pass | Bug resolved and claim revalidated |
