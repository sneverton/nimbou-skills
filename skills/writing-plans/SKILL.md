# Writing Plans

## Overview

Write implementation plans for backend work assuming the engineer has zero context for the codebase. The plan must force good boundaries, make the NestJS and Prisma structure explicit, and leave little room for architecture drift.

Assume the engineer is competent but does not know the domain, layering rules, or test strategy.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Save plans to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`
- User preferences override this default.

## Scope Check

If the approved spec still covers multiple independent subsystems, split it before writing the plan. Each plan should produce working, testable software on its own.

## File Structure First

Before writing tasks, map the file structure and responsibility of each file.

- Make the boundary explicit:
  - controller or transport
  - DTOs and validation
  - application or use-case layer
  - domain contracts or policies
  - infrastructure adapters and Prisma repositories
  - tests per boundary
- Keep Prisma outside controllers and use-cases unless the existing codebase already violates this and the plan includes the cleanup.
- In existing codebases, follow established patterns when they are sound. If the current structure is muddy, plan the smallest refactor that restores a clean boundary.

This file map drives the task decomposition.

## Task Granularity

Each step should be a small action, typically 2-5 minutes:

- write the failing HTTP or use-case test
- run it to prove it fails
- implement the minimal controller, use-case, or repository code
- rerun the test
- commit

## Plan Document Header

Every plan MUST start with this header:

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use nestjs-skills:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or nestjs-skills:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about NestJS modules, boundaries, and Prisma ownership]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

---
```

## Task Structure

````markdown
### Task N: [Use-case or Slice Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `src/modules/...`
- Modify: `src/...`
- Test: `test/...` or `src/...spec.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```ts
describe('CreateInvoiceUseCase', () => {
  it('rejects duplicate external references', async () => {
    await expect(
      sut.execute({ externalReference: 'dup-1' }),
    ).rejects.toThrow(DuplicateInvoiceReferenceError)
  })
})
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pnpm test -- --runInBand path/to/spec`
Expected: FAIL with the missing behavior or missing provider error that proves the test is real

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```ts
@Injectable()
export class CreateInvoiceUseCase {
  constructor(
    @Inject(INVOICE_REPOSITORY)
    private readonly invoiceRepository: InvoiceRepository,
  ) {}

  async execute(input: CreateInvoiceInput): Promise<CreateInvoiceOutput> {
    const existing = await this.invoiceRepository.findByExternalReference(
      input.externalReference,
    )

    if (existing) {
      throw new DuplicateInvoiceReferenceError(input.externalReference)
    }

    return this.invoiceRepository.create(input)
  }
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pnpm test -- --runInBand path/to/spec`
Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

Run: `git add <exact files> && git commit -m "feat: implement [task name]"`
````

## No Placeholders

These are plan failures:

- `TBD`, `TODO`, `implement later`
- `Add validation`, `handle edge cases`, `add proper error handling`
- `Write tests for the above` without actual test code
- `Similar to Task N`
- references to types, functions, or methods not defined in any task
- `Create DTO/use-case/repository as needed` without exact names and locations
- `Use Prisma here` without defining which adapter or repository owns that access

## Planning Rules For This Repository

- Default to a task sequence that protects boundaries:
  1. contracts and tests
  2. use-cases and domain services
  3. repositories and Prisma adapters
  4. NestJS transport wiring
  5. verification and review
- If the request is HTTP-facing, include controller, DTO, guard, filter or interceptor, and route-level verification tasks.
- If the request is persistence-heavy, include repository contracts, Prisma adapters, fixture strategy, and integration-test tasks.
- If the request spans both, make dependency direction explicit so application logic does not depend on Prisma or NestJS transport details.
- If the plan is better expressed as execution groups with dependencies, include `## Grupos de Execucao` so `executing-plans` can run in group mode.

## Remember

- exact file paths always
- complete code in every code-changing step
- exact commands with expected output
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits
- the plan should read like a Clean Architecture implementation guide, not a generic checklist

## Self-Review

After writing the complete plan, check:

1. **Spec coverage:** every approved requirement maps to one or more tasks
2. **Placeholder scan:** no red-flag placeholders remain
3. **Type consistency:** later tasks use the same names and signatures defined earlier
4. **Boundary consistency:** controllers stay thin, use-cases stay framework-light, Prisma stays in infrastructure tasks
5. **Test coverage:** the plan proves behavior at HTTP, application, and persistence levels when relevant

Fix issues inline before handing off the plan.

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan, offer the execution choice:

**"Plan complete and saved to `docs/plans/<filename>.md`. Two execution options:**

**1. Subagent-Driven (recommended)** - I dispatch a fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration

**2. Inline Execution** - Execute tasks in this session using executing-plans, with checkpoints and dependency-aware group execution when the plan defines groups

**Which approach?"**

If Subagent-Driven is chosen:
- use `nestjs-skills:subagent-driven-development`

If Inline Execution is chosen:
- use `nestjs-skills:executing-plans`
