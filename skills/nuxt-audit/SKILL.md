# Nuxt Audit

Read `reference/quality-rules.md` before auditing.

This is the single frontend review pass for Nuxt/Vuetify work in this repository. Do not split the review into separate "harden", "extract", "optimize", or "polish" passes. Cover all of those dimensions here.

## Guideline Resolution

Before auditing, locate the nearest `GUIDELINES.md` for the area being changed.

Resolution order:
1. If the request names a route, page, feature, or component path, start from that directory and walk upward.
2. If the request does not name a path, infer the likely ownership area from the target feature and inspect that subtree first.
3. Use the first local `GUIDELINES.md` you find as the primary source.
4. If a broader project-level `GUIDELINES.md` also exists higher in the tree, use it as fallback context only.

If no `GUIDELINES.md` exists, continue with the repository rules, call out the missing guideline file as a `Sugestao`, and suggest bootstrapping one from `reference/guidelines-template.md`.

## Severity

- Critico - breaks architecture, maintainability, resilience, or user-visible correctness.
- Atencao - convention drift, weak reuse, or performance debt that should be fixed soon.
- Sugestao - non-blocking improvement, guideline gap, or cleanup opportunity.

## Audit Dimensions

- Componentizacao e ownership
- Arquitetura, SOLID, e fluxo de dados
- Reuso e extracao de componentes, composables, utils, e config
- Hardening: erro, vazio, loading, overflow, i18n, e dados extremos
- Performance: rendering, requests, hydration, images, and bundle behavior
- Polish: spacing, alignment, consistency, copy seams, and visual drift
- Convencoes Nuxt e Vuetify
- Catalogo
- CSS e SCSS

## Audit Method

1. Read the nearest `GUIDELINES.md` and extract the local rules that apply to the target area.
2. Inspect the route/page owner first, then child components, composables, stores, and styles.
3. Compare the implementation to existing patterns before inventing a better one.
4. Separate issues by type:
   - bug or broken behavior
   - guideline drift
   - missing extraction opportunity
   - hardening gap
   - performance or polish debt
5. Do not fix code. Produce a report that can drive the next implementation pass directly.

## Output

Produce a report with:

### Resumo

- Scope audited
- Guideline files consulted
- Counts per severity

### Achados

List each finding with:
- severity
- area
- file or feature reference
- why it is a problem
- the smallest concrete correction direction

### Proximo passo sugerido

End with one concrete next command or next action, using the findings as input for the implementation pass in the current session.
